    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 # pork shoulder</li>
        <li>1/2 # pig's feet</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cumin powder</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cayanne</li>
        <li> 2 tbsp california chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>4 cups canned white hominy, 
            drained and rinsed </li>
        <li>3-5 cups pork broth from cooking pork shoulder and feet</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the onion, peel the garlic, chop the onion, peel and chop the 2 garlic cloves, 
            chop the green chilies and jalapenos if you are using them and get the hominy drained and rinsed.</li>
        <li>Place the meat in a large saucepan and just cover with lightly salted water.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 chopped onion, the 2 cloves peeled garlic, pepper, cumin, and oregano.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil over medium heat, skim off any foam that rises, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove meat and broth, reserving both.
            Saute the remaining chopped onion and garlic in oil until translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining spices, stir for a minute.
            Cut the reserved pork into 1 inch cubes and add to the pan.</li>
        <li>Stir in the canned hominy, pork broth (if there is not enough pork broth, add chicken stock,
            I like to add it anyway for flavor, about 2-4 cups, eyeball the amount you like), green chilies and jalapenos (optional).
        </li>
        <li>Cook at a simmer, covered, for 45 to 60 minutes until the meat and hominy are tender.</li>
        <li>If necessary, cook for up to an additional 60 minutes until the chilies and onions are well blended into the broth.</li>
        <li>Degrease the stew, taste for salt, and serve in soup bowls.</li>
    </ol>

        </ul>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice Beef into small dices, it helps if the beef is really cold and use a sharp knife. 
            Set beef aside once all diced.</li>
        <li>Slice bacon into small slices. Heat a large pot or dutch oven, medium heat. Cook bacon until crispy. 
            Remove from pot and drain on a paper towel lined plate. Reserve just 1 tablespoon of the bacon grease and remove the rest of the grease from the pot.
            Add cooked bacon back to pot and reserve some bacon to garnish soup (optional). Add whole green onion stalks and saute with bacon for about a minute.
        </li>
        <li>Add diced beef into pot with bacon and green onions. Season with beef bouillon and salt.
            While beef is cooking, place washed tomatillos, (serrano or jalapeno for spice) a teaspoon of salt, and Â¼ cup of water into a blender. 
            You can also add the cilantro in the blender or place it whole in the soup.
If you do not have a high powered blender, then boil tomatillos for 3 minutes to soften them.
        </li>
        <li>Once beef is no longer pink, add cilantro (whole), and pour in tomatillo sauce. Add water to cover beef and bring to a boil. Once boiling reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes or longer if the beef is still tough.</li>
        <li>Remove cilantro and green onions from soup. Taste broth and see if additional salt is needed.</li>
        <li>To serve, place a few spoonfuls of beans into a bowl and ladle in the carne en su jugo. Top with chopped cilantro, extra bacon, and serve with warm tortillas. Other toppings include: Sliced Radishes, Diced White Onion, Salsa Verde, or Sliced Avocado.</li>
    </ol>

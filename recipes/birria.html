    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Birria is a popular Mexican dish that originated in the Jalisco state. 
        It is traditionally made with lamb meat, but it is common for people to use beef today since 
        it is more affordable and easier to find throughout Mexico and the United States. 
    </p>
    <p>There are a few different ways to enjoy Birria. The first is as “consome” which is a type of soup, or stew using dried chiles and other spices. 
        For that variety, the meat is shredded and served in the soup. That is why it is important for the meat to be cooked until it is very tender.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <h4>For the Meat</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Lb Beef shank</li>
        <li>1 Lb Beef loin</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tbsp Salt</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Pepper</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Ground Cumin</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Sauce/Broth</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Dried Ancho Chiles</li>
        <li>4 Dried Guajillo Chiles</li>
        <li>1 Chipotle Pepper</li>
        <li>8 Peppercorns</li>
        <li>2 cloves</li>
        <li>1 Tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Marjoram</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Dried Oregano</li>
        <li>2 Bay Leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 Tsp Ground Cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 Tsp Ground Ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 Cinnamon Stick</li>
        <li>8 Cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 Large Onion</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tbsp Salt</li>
        <li>4 Red Tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cups Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the meat with salt, pepper, and cumin</li>
        <li>Cut open the dried chiles with scissors and remove the seeds</li>
        <li>Fry the dried chiles with a small amount of oil in a frying pan for 2-3 minutes, moving constantly so they don't burn. Set aside</li>
        <li>Add the chiles from the previous step to a small pot with boiling water for about 10 minutes, or until softened.</li>
        <li>In the same frying pan where you fried the chiles, add 1 tablespoon of oil and cook the onions and tomatoes until they are browned.
            Add the garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, cinnamon stick, and all of the remaining spices except for the ground cumin and ginger.
            Continue cooking for about 5 minutes, moving it around often.
        </li>
        <li>Add the chiles (including the water), the ingredients from the previous step, and the ginger, cumin, apple cider vinegar and water to a blender and blend until smooth.
            It will still be pretty thick, but that is fine. Strain and set aside the resulting sauce for the next step.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the sauce over the meat in a large bowl and cover. If using the oven or stovetop methods, you will want to marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Add the meat with the marinade to a large oven-safe dish and cover with aluminum foil and cook at 350 degrees fahrenheit for 2 hours or until the meat is easy to shred.</li>
        <li>Remove the meat and shred it. You can then serve it over the soup made from the sauce that the meat cooked in or you can serve it with tortillas as tacos with cilantro, lime, onions, and salsa.</li>
    </ol>
